            "moreDetails": "The amount of weight you use depends on how many repetitions you’re aiming for. You want to lift enough weight so that the last repetition is really tough and you feel like you couldn’t do one more. Naturally, you’ll need to use a heavier dumbbell for 6 repetitions than you will for 12, even though you’re doing the same exercise.Never lift so much weight that it causes pain. You are better off lifting too little than too much as your body gets used to weight training. Also, unless you are working out with a spotter, use machines with safety stops in place to prevent injury.",

Think about the leg burn that builds during a nonstop ski run, for example. Early in the season, the burn can be brutal. A little preseason strength and conditioning work will go a long way toward allowing you to link turns with style, top to bottom. “Kettlebells are an excellent training tool for that tension,” Seelig says. “Plus, for a lot of people, they’re more fun than machines and less intimidating than a barbell loaded with weight.”",

Because assistance muscles are typically smaller and weaker, forcing them to handle excessive torque is a recipe for pain and injury. Worse, if your lifts aren’t activating primary muscles because you can’t achieve full range-of-motion, you probably won’t even build the muscle you’re working toward.But let’s say you already warm up when you get to the gym. Isn’t that enough? Well…probably not.",
